# Camera - Over The Shoulder

Camera - Over The Shoulder is a mod for [Space Engineers](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/) that adds an additional camera option, inspired by the over-the-shoulder camera view commonly used in modern third-person shooters and action games. This camera mode places the viewpoint above the back of the player's shoulder, providing a dynamic and immersive experience similar to those seen in films and television.

## Features

- **Third-Person Compatibility:** Works even if third-person or spectator cameras are disabled.
- **Collision Detection:** The camera checks for collisions with the game world, preventing clipping.
- **Zoom Levels:** Offers two different zoom levels for better control.
- **Controller-Friendly:** Fully compatible with controller setups.
- **Weapon and Tool Integration:** Works seamlessly with guns and tools equipped.
- **Versatile Display:** Supports all screen ratios and field of view (FOV) settings.

## Chat Config Commands

Customize your camera experience with the following chat commands:

- `/otscam hold <true/false>`: If set to false, the player does not need to hold the "Secondary Action key" [RightMouseButton] to zoom.
- `/otscam zoom <true/false>`: If set to false, zoom is disabled and the "Secondary Action key" [RightMouseButton] will have no effect.
- `/otscam enabled <true/false>`: If set to false, the Shoulder Camera is disabled. Useful for players who prefer not to use it, even if the server supports it.
- `/otscam collision <true/false>`: If set to false, the camera will not collide with the world. Available only locally or to server admins.
- `/otscam left <true/false>`: If set to true, the camera will be positioned on the left side, which might look unusual as the character uses the right shoulder to aim.
- `/otscam keybind <true/false>`: If set to false, the camera will not cycle using the "Camera Mode key" [V]. The Shoulder Camera can still be accessed with the [F9] key, or by pressing "Alt + V" as an alternative when in first-person view.

**Example Command:** `/otscam zoom true`

Configurations are saved to the mod settings folder and persist across world saves.

## Using It in Interiors

Unlike many games with shoulder cameras that are designed with specific level layouts to minimize camera collisions, Space Engineers provides a high degree of freedom in design. As a result, players may experience camera collisions in confined spaces. You can disable collision detection using the command above, but this might cause the camera to see through walls in certain scenariosâ€”especially why this feature is disabled in multiplayer.

With practice, you can learn to manually adjust the camera position to avoid most collisions by moving it away from walls.
